🌦️ **Weather Prediction Model using Python**
📘 **Project 3 — Internship at Supreme Softs**

---

### 📄 **Project Overview**

This project analyzes and predicts weather patterns using historical meteorological data. It uses **K-Means clustering** to group days into similar weather types (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, and Windy) and applies **Random Forest Classifier** to predict future temperature trends. The goal is to visualize climate behavior and anticipate upcoming weather conditions based on past data.

### 🚀 **Technologies Used**

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – for data cleaning and manipulation
* **NumPy** – for numerical operations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – for clustering and regression modeling

---

### 📊 **Key Steps**

1. **Data Cleaning:** Removed null and irrelevant data columns.
2. **Normalization:** Scaled weather features for consistent comparison.
3. **K-Means Clustering:** Grouped weather patterns into 4 major types.
4. **Cluster Labeling:** Assigned descriptive names (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, Windy).
5. **Visualization:** Plotted clusters and feature relationships using scatterplots.
6. **Temperature Prediction:** Used Random Forest Classifier to predict future temperatures.
7. **Performance Evaluation:** Compared actual vs predicted values and visualized results.

### 📁 **Files Included**

* `Weather_Prediction_Model.ipynb` — Google Colab notebook with full implementation.
* `weatherHistory.csv` — Dataset used for analysis and prediction.

### 🎯 **Outcome**

* Successfully clustered multiple weather patterns into meaningful groups.
* Built a regression model to forecast upcoming temperature trends.
* Created visual insights that clearly show weather behavior and variation over time.
